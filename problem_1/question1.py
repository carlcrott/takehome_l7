#### Part 1
>> ingest the attached example file

So we need to sort out which columns which might be which.

How complex is the total solution space?

This could literally be endlessly complex.

First off we should dump any errors -- so if were ingesting something that fails, well we have an example of WHAT failure happened.

We should test one of the columsn to see if it matches against a known-true solution: EX: States explitic, and State abbreviated.

Im not exactly sure what this data should be.

It SAYS its a 'census' ...so we assume population?

I suppose I could just graph all 3 and just roll the dice on everything?
